<h2>FLYING</h2>

<h2>CAR RENTAL</h2>

<p>There are rentals both in and outside the terminal (shuttle service). Having a car is the most flexible option for
    sightseeing once you're in Bușteni / Sinaia. Normally the trip to Bușteni is 1.5 hours, however, please be aware
    that the road DN 1 (Bucharest - Bușteni) can be very busy as many people enjoy spending the weekends in the
    mountains. So avoid being in a rush and take your time on that road. <a

<h2>TRAIN</h2>
<p>You can order a taxi inside the Airport Terminal or take an Uber to the Bucharest "Gara de Nord" main train station.
    From Gara de Nord (Bucharest main train station) there are multiple trains to Bușteni, roughly every hour at peak
    times. The fastest trains are IR or IRN (not the R trains, they take longer), which will take you directly to Sinaia
    / Bușteni in 1,5-2 hours. Sinaia and Busteni are adjacent stops, 8 min apart. Interesting historical note: "People
    say that King Carol I, aboard the Orient Express, asked for the train to stop in Sinaia, inviting all its passengers
    to the Peles Castle and the stop in this lovely mountain resort has been a tradition ever since." <a

<h2>ACCOMODATION</h2>
<h3>Sinaia or Bușteni</h3>
<p>Situated next to the Bucegi National Park, Sinaia and Bușteni are just 5 km apart. Both are popular holiday
    destinations with cable cars ascending to the Bucegi Plateau.<br>

    Sinaia is a more luxurious and lively mountain resort, with nicer architecture and a long-standing hospitality
    heritage. There are many options, one of which is Hotel International right in the heart of the city.<br>

    Bușteni is a favorite among hikers, with more rustic accommodation. Less lively in the evening, the town has
    spectacular mountain views and is the starting place of many hikes.<br>

    Although close, the Zamora neighborhood around the Castle is a recent tourist development.<br>

    Whichever your choice, we will provide transport so you can get to and from the Castle with ease.</p>
