    <h2>FLYING</h2>
    <p> The main airport to fly into is Bucharest International Airport "Henri Coanda", about 2-2.5 hours by car / train to Busteni.<br>
        Smaller international airports are: Sibiu International Airport, 2 hrs 50 min by car to Busteni, and Cluj (International Airport Avram Iancu Cluj), 4.5 hours by car (train connections are significantly slower).

    <h2>CAR RENTAL</h2>
    <p>In all airports above, there are rentals both in and outside the terminal (shuttle service). Having a car is the most flexible option
        for sightseeing once you're in Bușteni / Sinaia. <br>
        Without traffic, the trip Bucharest - Bușteni is 1.5 hours. However,
        traffic jams are frequent as many people enjoy spending weekends in the mountains. Thus, avoid being in a rush
        and take your time on that road. We do not have much experience driving from the other airports.

    <h2>TRAIN</h2>
    <p>From the airport ("Aeroport Henri Coanda") there are trains to Bușteni / Sinaia, connecting through Bucharest
        North (Bucuresti Nord). The train service between the airport and Bucharest North runs round the clock every 40 min. The trip takes 25 min.
        From Bucharest North, the fastest trains are IR or IRN, direct to Sinaia and
        Bușteni. Sinaia and Busteni are adjacent stops, 8 min apart. Depending on your connection in Buucharest North, the total
        trip time airport - Busteni is 2 to 3.5 hrs. Masks are compulsory aboard the train. <br>
        Interesting historical note: "People
        say that King Carol I, aboard the Orient Express, asked for the train to stop in Sinaia, inviting all its
        passengers to the Peles Castle, and the stop in this lovely mountain resort has been a tradition ever since." <br>

    <h2>ACCOMODATION</h2>
    <h3>Sinaia or Bușteni</h3>
    <p>Situated next to the Bucegi National Park, Sinaia and Bușteni are just 5 km apart. Both are popular holiday
        destinations with cable cars ascending to the Bucegi Plateau.<br>

        Sinaia is a more luxurious and lively mountain resort, with nicer architecture and a long-standing hospitality
        heritage. There are many options, one of which is Hotel International right in the heart of the city.<br>

        Bușteni is a favorite among hikers, with more rustic accommodation. Less lively in the evening, the town has
        spectacular mountain views and is the starting place of many hikes. Although close to the wedding venue,
        the Zamora neighborhood around the Castle is merely a recent tourist development.<br>

        Whichever your choice, we will provide transport for the main event so you can get to and from the Castle with
        ease.</p>
